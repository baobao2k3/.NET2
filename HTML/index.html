        For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF
        works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver
        innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
